### More Information

Currently, I'm interested in remote opportunities with backend and/or data roles.

I'm a software engineer who specializes in backend engineering. If you're looking for an communicative, thoughtful, and creative software engineer with extensive full stack experience, contact me.

I'm also curious about too much. Topics I'm deeply interested in regarding software are:
* databases
* DevOps
* distributed systems
* machine learning
* data science
* design
* quantum computing
